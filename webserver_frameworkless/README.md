# Frameworkless WebServer
The goal here is to implement a **simple** WebServer in Java **without** frameworks and libraries.  
The WebServer should be configurable, for example: the consumer of your WebServer should be able to provide the preferred port.  
It should be easy to perform tests via unit tests scripts

## Check List
- [ ] No libraries or frameworks?
- [ ] A consumer can configure it?
- [ ] It is testable?
- [ ] Dockerized? (Good To Have)
